  ### About me:
  
</p>

Hey there ! ðŸ‘‹<br/>

My name is Dor Edelman ,I'm 26 years old , born and raised in Eilat.
During the COVID-19 pandemic i found myself at home for many hours seeking for entertainment , and decided to take a programming free course online just to challenge myself. for many hours i have learned from scratch the basics, and as I delved deeper into the subject, I fell in love with programming! 

After a year of self learning c and python tearing through any course i could find on anything remotly related to software development , i decided thats what i want to do in life , i found a passion of somthing and decided to chase my dream! 
Unfortunately , in my hometown, there are no institutions to study CS or requirement in the field ,
so I had to move.
I left Eilat and moved to Tel Aviv to start study Computer Science in The Academic College of Tel Aviv Yaffo.
moving out of my comfort zone is not a new thing to me , as a combat officer in the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps across the Gaza strip I have delt with life threating situations and learned how to work calmly under Sevier pressure , to accomplish my goals in precision and persistence.

Now I just can't wait to start working in the industry !
I am passionate about programming , full of motivation for learning new technologies, growth and innovation.
So , if you think I'm the right person for you, feel free to contact me !
